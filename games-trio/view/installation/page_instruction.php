					</div>
				<div id="telo">
					First, you will need the Daemon Tools and WinRAR 
					(or similar software) before you start installing the game. 
					If you do not have them, you can download from here:
						<div id="program-download">
							<a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0" target="_blank">
								<div class="download-link">
									Download WinRAR
								</div>
							</a>
							<a href="https://megaup.net/d0Uv/DaemonToolsPro.Advanced.v5.3.0.0359.rar" target="_blank">
								<div class="download-link">
									Download Daemon Tools
								</div>
							</a>
							<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
							<div id="text-box">
								1. Extract files
							</div>
						</div>
						Always remember to turn off the Firewall as well as 
						Antivirus before extracting and installing, 
						as they will block or delete cracked files during extracting/installation. 
						(If you want to ask why this happens, 
						the method used to crack games is similar to the method used to code malware! 
						Anti-virus programs will detect the crack as a virus and delete it, 
						even though it isnâ€™t!)

						2. After extracting .rar files, there will be 3 cases:
						<a href="index.php?page=s1" target="_self">
							<div class="download-link">
								CASE 1: You get the .iso file (or mds, cue, ..) after extracting
							</div>
						</a>
						<a href="index.php?page=s2" target="_self">
							<div class="download-link">
								CASE 2: You get the setup file after extracting
							</div>
						</a>
						<a href="index.php?page=s3" target="_self">
							<div class="download-link">
								CASE 3: There are no .iso files as well as no setup files after extracting
							</div>
						</a>
