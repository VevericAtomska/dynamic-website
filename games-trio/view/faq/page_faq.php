                        -It’s false positive. 
                        The method used to crack games is similar to the method used to code malware! 
                        Anti-virus programs will detect the crack 
                        as a virus and delete it, even though it isn’t!

                        -Try run the .exe file with “Run as Administrator”.
                        If the above steps don’t solve the problem, 
                        try turning off the Antivirus program as well as the Firewall, 
                        then extract / reinstall the game. 
                        Try running the game with “Run as Administrator” again.
